# Intro to Python

## Learning Goals

- Understand how to learn a new programming language
- Learn the benefits and philosophy of Python as a language

## Conclusion

You've learned a lot in this first module of Phase 3:

- How to execute code using the Python shell.
- Python's many data types.
- Common errors and Exceptions in Python.
- How Python handles sccope and organizes code blocks using indentation.
- How to control flow using functions, conditionals, and loops.

Python shares many similarities with JavaScript, but it presents many added
benefits as well. Your new knowledge of the fundamentals of Python programming
will allow you to create powerful applications that work closely with the data
on your computer (as well as other servers and databases!) to accomplish almost
any task you can imagine.
